# 🔬 Ms Temperature Prediction in HSLA Steels

**Undergraduate Project (MSE497) | IIT Kanpur**  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Amarendra Kumar Singh

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **data-driven machine learning framework** to predict the **Martensite Start Temperature (Ms)** of **High-Strength Low-Alloy (HSLA)** steels using their chemical composition. By leveraging various ML algorithms and ensemble learning methods, the model provides accurate and interpretable predictions aligned with metallurgical understanding.

## Approaches Used

- **Data Preprocessing & Curation**  
  - Removed outliers (especially high-Nickel compositions) to improve interpretability  
  - Applied z-score normalization for model readiness

- **ML Models Explored**  
  - Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting, XGBoost (Grid Search + Optuna), SVM  
  - ANN (MLPRegressor), Stacking Ensemble

- **Ensemble Learning Techniques**  
  - Bagging, Boosting, Stacking  
  - Final model used: **Stacked Ensemble** of XGBoost + MLP + GBR + Extra Trees with Linear Regression as meta-learner

## Final Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **R² Score** | 0.9018 |
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | 17.06 K |

• Improved generalization  
• Interpretability aligned with metallurgical theory  
• Final model outperformed individual regressors
